# Text Machine: Computing Literary Innovation 
		
## Project description.

Text Machine is a two-year research project funded by the [Schmidt Sciences Humanities and AI Virtual Institute](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/humanities-and-ai-virtual-institute/). It investigates moments of literary innovation and surprise across historical texts, specifically in relation to moments of technological change. 

Language models tend to reproduce linguistic norms, producing outputs that converge on the statistically average. Text Machine turns that limitation into a feature.  By modelling convention, language models allow us to identify moments of literary surprise and innovation - points where historical texts diverge from expected patterns of language.

This project builds on earlier work on the [Living with Machines](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) project, which explored the trope of the animate machine by looking for moments where we were able to ‘surprise’ a model we had fine-tuned on 19th-century texts: we were looking specifically at cases in which the model predicted tokens that typically correspond to animate entities when masking machine-related words. 

Text Machine extends this approach through a longitudinal and multilingual study of writing about technology from 1473 to the present. Our models and datasets cover English, with comparative analyses in Spanish, French, Italian, and Russian, tracing the lifecycle of linguistic innovation from coinage and metaphor to cliché and obsolescence. We also apply these methods to AI-generated and human–AI collaborative literature, asking how literary surprise is registered by—and might be designed into—language models.

The project will release open tools, datasets, and benchmarks to support research in literary studies, digital humanities, and AI.
